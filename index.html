A picture of education systems in Thailand is inspected with different filtering lenses. We are now focusing the preschool learning -- the beginning of learning. We see that we must take care of the children, the learners, from womb to school and beyond. We have to ensure health and fitness of body and mind. We have to provide safety and enabling conditions in environment. We have to support the children's families and the community surrounds. <b>In a simple term, we have to provide and support the world our children are growing and learning in.</b>
<br><br>This ‡πÄ‡∏£‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏ô ‡∏Å ‡∏Ç is a digital tool for the children's digital environment. The tool is aimed to support learning in a number of aspects. The tool provides 'free' facilities to learn a number of skills (to support equality in learning), with provisions for left and right brain development. Though there is not yet any 'firm' research and study to equate skills to left or right brains, it is accepted that language, reading, writing, speaking, mathematics, and analytical or logical skills (language, maths and logics) are left-brain skills. While sensing, especially visual sense, creativity and emotional composure (arts, intuition and feelings) are right-brain skills. However we can agree on this: it is preferable that we have both well developed left and right brains rather than just one side of our brain; and that if we succeed in developing both sides of the brain, there can be unprecedented benefits to our future society.
<br><br>Digital environment offers fast changing emergent conditions, niche opportunities and risks that need more frequent learning and unlearning. Having skills in digital environment seems 'normal' and necessary in this 21st century. Digital tools can also offer leverage to offset many learning difficulties in traditional environment (physical classrooms, shortage of trained teachers, costs, equality, and so on). But digital tools also create new difficulties (for examples: dependency on energy, digital communication networks and synchronization).
<br><br><b>Has this digital been officially proven or approved for children learning?</b><br>No. This tool suite contains a digital aid for 'reading'; a digital aid for 'writing', a digital piano keyboard for 'learning musical notes', a visual aid for 'dancing'(still in development), a set of children games, and more are to be developed and added. It is a free tool, you can try and approve yourselves. Your help in advice and donation is welcome.

<h2 id="read">‡∏≠‡πà‡∏≤‡∏ô</h2>
The reader tool allows selecting a book from the 'book' folder. (Click on [browse] button and navigate to /book folder then select a file to read) A preview of content will be shown. When the '‡∏≠‡πà‡∏≤‡∏ô' button is clicked, the content of the book is display in easy to read large prints. When a word or phrase is touched or clicked on, reader aid is displayed with alphabets, vowels and tone marks in different colors.
<br><br>At present the tool only offers visual aid. Audio aid is being pursued.

<h2 id="write">‡πÄ‡∏Ç‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏ô</h2>
The writer tool is a also a game to write as many words as we can from a given set of letters, vowels and tone marks --randomly selected -- all of these when clicked on will give audio aid. Each word is saved in another box, so that the results can be shared among friends for comments and verification.
<br><br>The words are written by drag-and-drop -- drag a letter from the top box to the second box in order as we would type on a keyboard. When the second button is clicked the written word is copied into the third box. On some browsers (Chrome for example) this drag-and-drop works well on PC but not so well on mobile phones. We are looking into it.
<br>We also welcome help.

<h2 id="sing">‡∏£‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏á</h2>
The singer tool is a simple aid to learn music notes and to recognize the musical pitches (as recognized internationally). A part of a piano keyboard on the colorful music sheet is also provided. The colors of the rainbow is applied to notes in the same order (ROYGBIV : Red Orange Yellow Green [sky]Blue Indigo Violet). The music pitch rises higher along the (CDEFGAB) scale.
We can play simple songs with this key board. For examples:
<ul>
<li>Jingle Bell: <br>
E E 2E, E E 2E, E G C D, 4E, F F 2F, E E EE, E D D E, 2D 2G, E E 2E, E E 2E, E G C D, 4E, F F 2F, E E 2E, G G F D, 4C.
<li>Twinkle Little Star:<br> 
G G D D, E E 2D, C C B B, A A 2G, D D C C, B B 2A, D D C C, B B 2A, G G D D, E E 2D, C C B B, A A 2G
</ul>
<br>
NB. By a convention we write a note in this format: [t]X[o] where [t] is duration of time (in second; omitted if 1 s for a quarter note; a half note is 2 s, a full note is 4 s) of the note X (one of the 12 notes: A A# B C C# D D# E F f# G G#) and [o] is the octave for the note usual omitted for octave 4. So 1E4 means 1 second long note E of octave 4, gets abbreviated to E4 or E.
<br><br>The A4 note on this keyboard is tuned to 432 Hz (instead of the common 440 Hz), the pitches are a tiny bit flatter and softer. This is done on (anecdotal) suggestions that tuning to 432Hz may have calming effects on listeners. We do want children to be calm while playing. And we do want parents to be calmer when they have to listen to the music their children play (on our keyboard) for some time ;-)

This is an ambitious project and a not-for-self-interest project. Yes we do expect profit but not for ourselves but for further betterment of the tool and the learners. We will need help in many ways:
<ul>
<li> Learning devices (smart phones, tablets, and computers) for children who have difficulties accessing digital environment; 
<li> communication network services (wifi hotspots, internet connection, online meeting services) to allow sharing among children); 
<li> more ideas and more content for learning (stories to read, puzzles, games and exercises to develop skills);
<li> donation - because we cannot pay for all we aim to provide.
</ul>
<br><br>We welcome help in many ways: reporting bugs, suggestions for improvement or targeting, coding and writing, donations and promotions.
Contact: s dot rathmanus at gmail dot com if you can offer help --please say which kinds.
